# Hangman
the game of hangman implemented in a variety of ways 

In this branch, we focus on creating the moving the game from the command line into its own application, 
using the acm library, produced by Standford University, to add the graphics of a "hung man" appreaing as the letters are revealed to be incorrect,


Thanks to the MVC model, the command line view can be easily swapped out for a application view so that only the interaction with user input has to be redone.

To run this code, you will need the acm.jar executable, which can be downloaded [here](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/jtf/)
